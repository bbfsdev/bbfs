Big brother file system (distributed file system).

Backup system:
Content server monitors a set of directories (blobs/patterns).
The files in those directories are indexed (calculating their SHA1).
Each unique content is backed up to the remote (backup) server.
The backup server also monitors a set of directories (blobs/patterns).
The files in those directories are also indexed.
The content server copies new/changed files in the backup server.
The backup server index those new files too and send the content data (their SHA1 to the original server).

To install the content server and backup server:
gem install content_server

Run content server:
> content_server
Rn backup server:
> backup_server
